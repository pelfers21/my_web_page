  <p>Actually, dogs are pretty smart.  They can learn a lot of tricks and are very playful.  You must have the patience to teach them, but they are very trainable.  I have had many dogs of all different sizes.  I prefer small dogs that do not shed their hair.  They are very expensive to have groomed regularly, but they do not shed as bad as short-haired dogs. They are also less allergenic for those people that allergic to dogs.</p>
